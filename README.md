> The only thing worse than documentation never written, is documentation written but never discovered.

**portray** is a Python3 command line tool and library that helps you create great documentation websites for your Python projects with as little effort as possible.

[![Example Usage Gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timothycrosley/portray/master/art/example.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timothycrosley/portray/master/art/example.gif) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/portray](https://badges.gitter.im/timothycrosley/portray.svg)](https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/portray?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Key Features:

* **Zero-Config**: No configuration is necessary to use `portray`. Just run `portray` in the root of your Python project and it will find your documentation.
* **Statically Generated**: `portray` websites are easy to host on GitHub pages and other similar services as they are outputted as standard static HTML website.
* **Markdown Aware**: `portray` will automatically include your projects `.md` files and render them into HTML. It will also find and render Markdown within `__doc__` strings.
* **Fully Configurable**: While `portray` doesn't have to be configured, you still can fully configure it withing the standard `pyproject.toml` file.
* **Easily Programmable**: `portray` exposes a clean and simple [Python API](https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/reference/portray/api/).
* **Searchable**: Out of the box `portray` makes all of your documentation, even autogenerated code references, free-text searchable.
* **Themeable**: `portray` is compatible with all existing [MkDocs Themes](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes).

Under the hood portray combines the [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) documentation rendering capabilities provided by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
with the automatic reference documentation generated by [pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/).
